        <h1>Healthy Food Recommender System</h1>
        <p>
            To build a Health Food Recommendation System I used unsupervised learning. "Nutrient profiling
            of foods, described as the science of ranking foods based on their nutrient content, is fast
            becoming the basis for regulating nutrition labels, health claims, and marketing and advertising
            to children. A number of nutrient profile models have now been developed by research scientists,
            regulatory agencies, and by the food industry. Whereas some of these models have focused on
            nutrients to limit, others have emphasized nutrients known to be beneficial to health, or some
            combination of both. Although nutrient profile models are often tailored to specific goals, the
            development process ought to follow the same science-driven rules. These include the selection
            of index nutrients and reference amounts, the development of an appropriate algorithm for
            calculating nutrient density, and the validation of the chosen nutrient profile model against
            healthy diets. It is extremely important that nutrient profiles be validated rather than merely
            compared to prevailing public opinion.
            The definition of healthy or nutrient dense foods has taken many forms over the years:
            more nutrients, fewer calories
            bucketing certain food groups as healthy: fruits, veggies, lean meats, etc
            bucketing certain foods as unhealthy: high fat (including nuts, olives, coconuts and avocados)
            (fat phobia)
            "dark-green leafy and deep-orange vegetables [as] especially good sources of vitamins and
            minerals"
            "Generally excluded from the definition of nutrient-dense foods were those that contained added
            fat, sugar, or sodium."
            Focus on Recommended Dietary Allowance - rigidity of this method disqualified a lot of foods
            Reference amounts: Gradients of nutrient density - "good source of", "excellent source of" vs.
            "free", "low", "reduced", "less"
            Tiers of foods
            "It is only recently that the FDA has explored the feasibility of allowing health claims if a
            food had a favorable nutrient profile, as an alternative to current measures based on grams of
            nutrients per serving"
            "Nutrient profile models can be based on 1) qualifying nutrients known to be beneficial to
            health, mostly vitamins and minerals; 2) disqualifying nutrients, mostly fats, sugars, and
            sodium; or 3) some combination of both. The content of fruits, vegetables, nuts, or whole grains
            in a food can also be taken into account."
            There are many algorithms used for nutrient profiling. The algorithm I used was Nutrient Rich
            Food Algorithm that calculates the percentage mean of Daily value of nutrients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nutrients to be used can be:
            Nutrients beneficial to health selected macronutrients (protein, fiber, essential fatty acids)
            vitamins (vitamins A and C), and minerals (calcium and iron), omega-3 fatty acids, B-vitamins
            and folate, and additional minerals, typically potassium, zinc, and magnesium
            Harmful nutrients FDA: total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium
            The next step is to clean the data and remove the unwanted columns and null values. Then the
            nutrient profile is calculated using the above algorithm. The nutrients are classified for all
            the food categories. Then I used the K-Means algorithm to cluster all the food groups with
            similar nutrient density. After the model is deployed the food recommender is used to recommend
            healthier options.

        </p>
        <p>
            Sample Outputs can be seen as below:
            <p>Input: Vanilla Ice Cream With Chocolate Wafers</p>
            <img style="max-width:100%;" src="images_used/result1.png">
            <p>Input: Cupcake </p>
            <img style="max-width:100%;" src="images_used/result2.png">

        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the other outputs are as below :

            Input: Cupcakes. Recommendation: Donuts (More Calcium, Lesser Sugar)
            Input: Pinto Beans. Recommendation: Black Beans. (More potassium, protein, calcium and iron)
            Input: Cheddar Cheese. Recommendation: Italian Cheese (More Vitamin A, less sodium)
            The results turned out to be very good as the recommender suggested a healthier food alternative
            when compared to the initial choice of food.

        <h1>Predicting Micronutrients Using Random Forest</h1>



        <p>
            I used supervised machine learning to predict micronutrients
            within certain foods. In this case, the input are records of the amount of nutrient
            composition within each food, and the task is to predict the micronutrients based on other
            nutrients and compare how far are the predicted values from the true values.
            Before building the model. I wanted to check the correlation among the variables.
            This can be as seen in the correlation plot.</p>
        <img style="max-width:100%;" src="images_used/cor_plot.png">
        <p> We can see that some of the nutrients are either
            positively correlated or show no correlation with other nutrients, while only a couple
            is negatively correlated.</p>

        <p>
            Now we chose the labels. I chose to predict Calcium, Iron, Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin D,
            Folate. First, we need to split the input data and labels in a training and test set. The
            Scikit-learn’s train_test_split function makes this process convenient. Now, we need to
            standardize our data before coding the model. This is important because some of the
            nutrients use different units. For example, Vitamin A uses the UI unit, while Carbohydrate
            uses the gram.
            We will be using Scikit-learn’s RobustScalerto standardize our data so that all of them are
            robust against the differences in units. Then we initialize the model and train it using the
            train data. Since we have a multiple output variable, we need to use MultiOutputRegressor to
            the random forest model.
            The models has an accuracy of 94% on the training data and 62% on the test data. The model
            does not overfit or underfit the data.
            A sample output for cheese is as follow:
            True value: Vitamin A- 650, Iron-0.31, Zinc-2.70, Calcium -500, Vitamin D-30, Folate- 16
            Predicted value: Vitamin A- 721, Iron-0.31, Zinc-2.66, Calcium -528, Vitamin D-21, Folate-
            36
